                        "answer": "Shake the bottle well to mix the oil and water phases, then apply a few drops to clean, dry skin. Follow it up with a moisturizing sunscreen during the day such as All I Need Sunscreen for Dry Skin and Ultra Light Water Sunscreen for Oily Skin. At night follow it up with Barrier Care Cream for best results."

                        "answer": "A bi-phasic serum offers the best of both worlds: deep hydration from the water phase and nutrient-rich nourishment from the oil phase. This structure mimics the skin's natural barrier, allowing better penetration and performance of active ingredients like brighteners and collagen boosters - which can lead to faster, more visible results."

                        "answer": "Yes! Formulated with melanin-inhibiting and brightening ingredients, this serum helps fade hyperpigmentation, sun spots, and acne marks over time. The dual-phase delivery ensures that brightening agents like niacinamide or vitamin C penetrate deeper, making the treatment more effective."

                        "answer": "The skin on your lips is more sensitive than the rest of your face, lacking melanins, the pigment that provides natural sun protection. This makes your lips susceptible to sun damage. Using Lip Balm SPF 50 PA++++ offers broad spectrum protection and moisturization for soft, supple lips."

                        "answer": "The skin on our lips is the thinnest, making it prone to UV damage. While a regular sunscreen protects the face and neck from sun damage, the lips stay exposed to it. Hence, we have specially formulated the Mango Lipscreen SPF 50 PA++++ to nourish and protect your lips from sun damage."
